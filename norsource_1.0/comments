Documentation on the grammar is available at http://www.typecraft.org/tc2wiki/Norwegian_HPSG_grammar_NorSource. A demo is accessible here, and also at http://august.hf.ntnu.no:8200/norsource (however, maintaining the connection between the demo and the current CVS is proving difficult, so what one sees on the demo is not necessarily an updated analysis).

The grammar follows the standard LKB/Matrix (Matrix0.6) grammar set up as concerns path architecture. 
Note that

- there are three type files:
        norsk.tdl, the main file;
        predsort.tdl, devoted mainly to types for spatio-temporal expressions 
        going beyond the most basic combinatorial needs;
        lex-types-v.tdl, doing a conversion from the 'old' verb types defined in 
	norsk.tdl from 2002 up to 2008, to those defined in Hellan and Dakubu 2009 
	(the 'Construction Labeling' types).

- there are many small size lexicon files:
        - lex1.close.tdl contains all closed class items except spatio-temporal
        prepositions and adverbs, and representatives of all subtypes of open 
        class items, including all verb types; 
        - lex2.open.tdl contains open class items supporting the test files 
        - lex3.p-adv-full.tdl contains all spatiotemporal prepositions and
        adverbs
        - lex4.propn1.tdl and lex4.propn2.tdl contain proper names supporting
        the test files (lex4.propn2.tdl devoted exclusively to the test file
        hike.no)
        - lex2.semlab.tdl has words with types adapted to special semantic
        specifications of more experimental nature

- there are also three large lexicon files - lex4.lrg-v.tdl, lex4.lrg-a.tdl and lex4.lrg-n.tdl, the latter very big and taken over as a word list from NorKompLeks, but with inflectional and grammatical information supplied here. (The same goes for the other two.)

- irules come in three versions, for v, a and n.

- test suites, with translations to English, are found in the directory /Tests:
       - test-v represents all verb frames, with comments, for the types defined by 2008
       - test-v-lrge represents all frames corrrresponding to those defined in lex-types-v.tdl
       - test-np represents most configurations inside NPs
       - test-p represents all uses of spatiotemporal prepositions and adverbs,
         with comments
       - test-dir represents more complex spatio-temporal constructions, and
         exemplifies calculation of aspect (...INDEX.PATH-TELIC bool)
       - test-cmpar represents constructions with comparatives and other degree
         specifications
       - test-clause represents constructions at clausal level, including
          - wh-dependencies (topicalization, relativization, constituent questions)
          - adverbial distribution
          - pronominal distribution
          - passive 
          - reflexives
          - coordination
          - punctuation in many environments
          - apposition
          - free predicatives
          - derivational morphology
       - mrs-suite, a counterpart to the same-named suite developed for English
       - hike-no, the first test suite used in the LOGON project
       - hike-no25first, a subpart of the above with full lexicon support

In the following we provide commentaries on general phenomena as analyzed in
 the grammar and exemplified in the test files. These commentaries will be

Clausal level phenomena

'Wh-movement'
The grammar deals only with 'properly governed traces', i.e., extraction of
complements, more specifically, NP complements of verbs and prepositions. 
This means that the head-filler-rule will not accommodate missing subjects, and
not 'missing' adjuncts. On the latter, see next point.

Adverbial placement
In a matrix clause, there are three main locations for adverbial elements:
(i) clause initial, 
(ii) after finite verb, and 
(iii) clause final (i.e., after all nuclear complements)
On (i):
Contrary to standard generative treatments, the clause initial position is
*not* accounted for via wh-movement/head-filler-rule; rather, it is one of the
directly assigned adverbial sites. It presupposes subj-verb-inversion, and
preempts the possibility of wh-fronting, factors straightforwardly regulated by
boolean features. Semantically, the adverbial is related to the matrix verb,
which leaves as a gap in the over-all account the situations where a fronted
adverbial relates to an embedded clause.
Since adverbials are ungoverned, fronted adverbials are never 'missing' in a
syntactic sense. 
Statistics done by Lars Johnsen indicates that in 90% of the cases where an
item distinct from the subject occupies the front position, this is done by an
adverbial. Moreover, this is a very frequent constellation in Norwegian. It
would not be plausible to have a syntactically unmotivated rule account for so
many cases, so we regard our analysis as linguistically plausible. (But
accounting for cases  where a fronted adverbial relates to an embedded clause -
although a not very frequent situation - remains to be accounted for.)

On (ii)
This is a position much preferred by so-called sentence adverbs, and avoided by
directional phrases. Boolean features are used to regulate access to the
position. 

On (iii)
S-adverbs avoid this position.

The three positions are accounted for by different rules. In cases where (ii)
and (iii) extensionally coincide, as in an intransitive construction, we want
to avoid doubling of parses; this is accomplished through boolean features.

In the spatio-temporal domain of adverbials, we recognize two distinctions:
- directional vs. 'event' m odification, formally reflected in whether the ARG1
of the adverbial is identified with a 'mover' argument of the verb, or with the
event index (of the verb); 
- adverbials inducing the telicity value ...PATH-TELIC +, vs. those that
don't. The former are directionals with what we call a *fix-point* value (a
start, via or end point), the latter are 'non-fixpoint' directionals and
'event'-adverbials, called 'sit(uational)-index' adverbials.
Three different combinatorial processes (VP + adverbial) are here needed: 
-- (a) inducing PATH-TELIC +  and ARG1 = mover: the adverbial is referred to as 'dir-fixpoint';
-- (b) inducing PATH-TELIC bool and ARG1 = mover: the adverbial is referred to as 'dir-non-fixpoint';
-- (c) inducing PATH-TELIC bool and ARG1 = sit-index: the adverbial is referred to as 'sit-index';
For positions (i) and (iii), all three types apply, for position (ii), only
(c). With 'adverbial' standardly meaning either a PP or an adverb-phrase, this
gives altogether 14  rules for combining adverbials with a V-projection; in
addition come cases where a time-NP combines with the V-projection (as in
"komme s√∏ndag" 'come (on) Sunday'), so all in all there are 17 rules in this
domain. (See further in the section 'Prepositions'.)
The test file 'test-dir' illustrates much of the above.

A further complexity resides in 'stacking' of adverbials, as in "down to the
river", "here under the bed": in principle such sequences can form a
constituent together, or they can be analyzed as iteration of VP-adjunction. In
the former case, we treat the first adverbial as head, and the second as an
adjunct. There are four possible such constellations (with internal iteration
in turn possible): adv-adv ("her nede", "opp
hit"), adv-PP ("her i Finnmark", "opp til toppen"), PP-PP ("langs bekken
nedover lia"), and PP-adv ("langs bekken hit"). In each constellation,
uniformity is required regarding the parameters (a)-(c): thus, a constituent of
this type has either of the structures 
'HEAD: dir-fixpoint, ADJCT: dir-fixpont'
'HEAD: dir-non-fixpoint, ADJCT: dir-non-fixpont'
'HEAD: sit-index, ADJCT: sit-index'
(when two consecutive adverbials are not uniform in this respect, the only
analysis is iterated VP-adjunction). Semantically, an important difference
between this adverbial-adjunction structure and the iterated VP-adjunction
structure is that in the former case, the ARG0 of each adverbial is the same,
meaning, in the case of directionals,  that the specifications induced by each
adverbial apply to the same part of the directional event; in contrast, when
iteratedly VP-adjoining, each adverbial ARG0 is distinct. When a comma
intervenes between two adverbials, iterated VP-adjunction is the only analysis
available. 
When one adverbial is adjoined to another, their
ARG1 has identical value (either the same mover, or the same head index). This
cannot be induced if we assign the adjunct adverb or preposition the same type
as they have when adjoining directly to a V-projection, therefore the system
has to recognize a 'series 2' of all adverbial-adjoinable adverbs and
prepositions. For details, see the comments on the test-file 'test-p', and the
section 'Prepositions' below.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Prepositions

Prepositions are treated semantically as two-place predicates; the arguments
are formally labelled ARG1 and ARG2, with ARG2 corresponding to the syntactic item
counted as *governed* by the preposition, the *governee*. The governee is in
most cases an NP, but can also be a finite clause or an infinitival
expression. In either case, the preposition and the governee are treated as a
constituent labelled 'PP'. This PP can identify
the ARG1 in a limited number of ways, most frequently through *modification*, but
also through carrying *argument* status. 
     When the PP is a modifier, the most typical case - encoded in the classification of the preposition as 'reg-mod-lex-item' - is that
the ARG1 is identical to the INDEX of the item modified: if the item modified
is a VP, then typically the ARG1 of the prepositional relation is an *event
index*, and if the item modified is a noun or NP, then typically the ARG1 of
the prepositional relation is a *referential index*. In NorSource this always
holds when the item modified is a noun, whereas when the item modified is a VP,
a further case is recognized where the PP is a *directional expression*: in a
construction like 'John runs to the farm', where "to" is a directional P, its
ARG1 will be the index of "John", i.e., the index of the *subject* of the verb,
and in a construction like 'John throws the stone out of the window', the
ARG1 of "to" will be the index of "the stone", i.e., the index of the *object*
of the verb (cf. Beermann and Hellan (2004); in these cases, the lexical type
of the P is 'dir-mod-lex-item').
The two main cases where the PP acts as an argument both involve a verb as the
head. One is where the PP expresses a predication of one of the NP arguments of
the verb, as in "put the vase on the table" - here the ARG1 of "on" is
identical to the referential index of "the vase". Another is where the P is
counted as *selected* by the verb, as in "rely on Peter", where "on Peter"
counts as an 'oblique' argument of "rely", or "talk to Peter", where "to Peter"
counts as an 'oblique' argument of "talk". Although the predictability of the
choice of preposition varies in such cases, and likewise the obligatoriness of
the PP, we uniformly count the preposition as meaning-bearing in these
constructions - thus, for English, even in "rely on Peter", where "on" is fully
predictable and the PP obligatory, "on" serves in a meaning similar to what it
has in "base on", "depend on", etc.. In these cases it is less obvious what to
count as the ARG1 of the preposition, but the choice made in NorSource is to
identify it with the INDEX of the verb, so that, e.g., the 'talk' event is seen
as 'to Peter'. As a specification of time or place of an event, this would not
make sense, but to the extent that we see the event 'intensionally', i.e., qua
a talking event, it makes sense to say that it is 'to' Peter.

The above provides the basic design of our treatment of prepositions. There are
many further cases: PPs modifying adverbs, as in "down along the path"; PPs
being arguments of adjectives, as in "fond of food"; and more. All cases find
their place in the general architecture now outlined, with the prepositional
relation taking an ARG1 and an ARG2, the types of these being in general either
event or ref-ind, and their identity established through combinatorial
mechanisms as sketched. 

Within this basic design, we now will focus on our
treatment of "til", and in particular, describe how we envisage capturing
a factor like the *gist* of "til" as outlined in section 1. This 'gist'
obviously resides somewhere in the semantics of the preposition, and our goal
is to establish a formal locus for its representation relative to the general
Matrix architecture, and the general approach to prepositions just sketched. We
proceed by 
(i) giving a brief outline of the classificatory resources of the
system, and showing how an array of uses of "til" can be accommodated within
this system;
(ii) with reference to some semantic properties implemented in this analysis,
which are important to the general grammatical combinatorics, showing a
detailed approach to spatio-temporal semantics as is currently implemented in
NorSource;
(iii) with this semantics as a background, assessing what further articulation
is needed to represent the 'gist' in a way rendering it amenable, e.g., to
translation purposes.

Classificatory resources in a Matrix grammar.
To distinguish types of prepositions, at least five slots for specification are
available in a Matrix grammar:

Parameter 1.
The 'sign' type, which, in the case of prepositions, will be subtypes of
'word';
Parameter 2.
The 'head' type, found at the specificational path
          SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD head
Parameter 3.
A type used for more or less ad hoc subclassification of 'head', found at the
path
          SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.KEYS.KEY predsort
Parameter 4.
The 'semsort' type, used for further semantic specification inside the INDEX
specification, thus at the path
          SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SORT semsort
Parameter 5.
The specification of what kinds of items the preposition can modify, found at
the path
          SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [LOCAL...] >
where what is specified inside of 'LOCAL' can be any combination of parameters
2, 3 and 4.

The specification of a preposition can avail itself of any combination of these
parameters. Given that each type by itself can be construed through a multiple
inheritance system, this is to say that the formal resources for specification
are quite rich.

We now illustrate ten different items "til" as recognized in NorSource, and
indicate how they are differentiated using the parameters mentioned. As will be
clear, while still falling short of fully covering the array of usages
mentioned in section 1, many of the usages are reflected, and more can be
added. For current purposes, more importantly, we will see that the possible
'gist' as such of "til" is not yet represented, giving rise to the subsequent
sections.

Instances of "til"
A. "til" heading a PP serving as modifier

Sign type: dir-fixpoint-prep-word, a descendant from dir-mod-lex-item:
gutten rusler til skogen
'the boy strolls to the wood'
hun kaster ballen til huset
'she throws the ball to the house'
det l√∏per en gutt til skogen
'there runs a boy to the wood'

Characteristics:
Parameters 3 and 4 are used in the specification
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SORT fix-point-motion,
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY pathconsumpt-dir ] ].
where the SORT specification is referred to by combinatorial rules calculating
the telicity value of the verbal construction where the PP takes part; here,
that value is 'telic', as opposed to 'atelic' for prepositions like "langs"
('along'). The KEYS.KEY specification informs rules of PP placement, for
instance in the following respect: while Norwegian in general allows PPs to
occur either fronted (a position we treat as a normal adverbial site, and not
as representing a wh-dependency), or immediately after the finite verb, or
after all NP arguments in a VP, directional PPs are less felicitous in the
second of these positions, and are excluded from occurring there through
reference to this KEYS.KEY value.
Parameter 5 is activated in having a MOD specification requiring the ARG1 of
the preposition be identical to the 'mover' argument of the verb (represented
by the attribute 'DIRARG'), formally of the form
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.DIRARG #1] >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.ARG1 #1
(as opposed to 'event-modifying' prepositions which have the corresponding
specification
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX #1] >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.ARG1 #1
- cf. the outline above).

Sign type: dir-fixpoint-prep-2-word
gutten rusler bort til skogen
The phrase "bort til skogen" has as a possible analysis the adverb "bort" as a
head and "til skogen" as a modifier. Relative to the verb, "til" behaves as in
the previous case, but since it now modifies the adverb, its MOD specification
now has to be such that both "bort" and "til" take the verb's DIRARG as their
ARG1. At the same time, the INDEX of "bort" and "til" will be identified, to
signal that "bort" and "til skogen" reflect aspects of one and the same
motion. Both of these factors sort under Parameter 5.

These two items "til" are obviously one and the same real lexical item,
formally distinguished only for combinatorial concerns. A common feature
specified is that their ARG2 has a SORT specification 'endpoint-of-path', a
value which is visible in the mrs output, and whose functionality in an
interpretive application is demonstrated in Beermann et al. 2005.


Sign type: time-prep-word
gutten sover til klokka tre
'the boy sleeps until 3 o'clock'


Sign type: nom-dir-fixpt-prep-word
bussen til Trondheim g√•r klokka tre
stien til fjellet g√•r herfra


Sign type: prep-word-poss
gutten til Ola sover


B. "til" heading a PP serving as argument

Sign type: prep-word-sel
jeg snakker til gutten
'I talk to the boy'
Is selected by verbs of type 'intrans-obl-arg1-verb-lexeme'


Sign type: prep-rais-word 
Usage 1:
gutten  ser   ut  til √• komme
boy-the looks out to to come
'the boy appears to come'
det   ser   ut  til √• komme en gutt
there looks out to to come  a boy
'there appears to come a boy'

"til" is here selected by a verb of type 
'intrans-secpred-prtcl2-rais-from-nonverbal-arg1-verb-lexeme'
and interacts with the phrasal rules 'head-prep-rais-comp-rule' (combining with
the infinitive) and 'head-verb-prep-comp-rule' (combining with the verbal
projection). ("ut" is of type 'adv-particle-word' and combines with the verb
through 'head-verb-advparticle-comp-rule'. " √•" is of type 'inf-comp' and
combines with the embedded VP through 'head-complementizer-comp-rule'.)

Usage 2:
Ola later til √• komme
det later til √• komme en gutt

The selecting verb is here of type
'intrans-secpred-rais-from-nonverbal-arg1-verb-lexeme', and the combination of
the PP with the verb goes through 'head-verb-preprais-comp-rule': otherwise as
above.

Usage 3:
han forplikter seg til √• komme

The verb belongs to type 'obj-equi-pp-refl-verb-lexeme'.


Sign type: prep-expl-dep-word
det ser  ut  til at  det kommer en gutt
it looks out to that there comes a boy
'it appears that there comes a boy"
Has the same context as the item above. The differentiation is purely
combinatiracally motivated, to account for a raising behavior versus expletive subject.



Sign type: som-n-pred-comp
Ola opph√∏yer seg til konge
'Ola elevates himself to king'

The selecting verb is of type
'trans-secpred-som-rais-refl-from-nonverbal-arg2-verb-lexeme', and interacting
rules are 'head-complementizer-noun-rule' and 'head-verb-som-comp-rule'.


C. Cases where "til" acts as an adverb (particle), selected by a verb.
 
Sign type: adv-particle-word
 KEYS.KEY til-pcl

Usage 1:
Ola hjelper til 
Ola hjelper til og spiser maten
The selecting verb is of type 'intrans-atelicparticle-arg1-verb-lexeme', and
combines with "til" through 'head-verb-advparticle-comp-rule'.

Usage 2:
Ola hjelper til med √• spise maten
The selecting verb is of type 'subj-prtcl-equi-pp-atelic-verb-lexeme', and
combines with "til" through 'head-verb-advparticle-comp-rule'. ("med" is of
type prep-rais-word - KEYS.KEY med-rais - and "med √• spise" combines with
"hjelper til" through 'head-verb-preprais-comp-rule'.)

Reflexives

The treatment of reflexives follows the outline in Hellan 2005.

Two main strategies apply.
(i) The reflexive, of form "seg" ("meg/deg/oss/dere"), may be said to belong
within the lexical frame of a verb, as a 'lexically tame' item; it may be a
DOBJECT, IOBJECT or the NP of a 'selected' PP. Being 'tame' does *not* mean:
'being without meaning', or 'being obligatory'. Technically, coreference
between binder and bindee is here encoded in the lexical specification of the
verb.  
(ii) The reflexive, of form "seg ("meg/deg/oss/dere) (selv)", or possessive
"min/din(sin/v√•r/deres", induces an 'I must be bound' requirement which is
propagated up during the combinatorial mechanism, and released when a
possible binding configuration and a possible binder are found. An unreleased
'I must be bound' requirement blocks the derivation. The attribute encoding
propagated information is '...LOCAL.BND-RESP <...>'.

The formal treatment has so far one major limitation: it propagates the 'I must
be bound' requirement only for one binder at the time, which means that we
allow only one reflexive binder per clause, where the reflexives bound, if
many, must either all be of the form '[REFL-I +, REFL-II +]'
("selv"-reflxives), or all of the form '[REFL-I +, REFL-II -]', which comprises
non-lexically bound "seg" ("meg/deg/oss/dere") and the posessives. It is well
known that with productive patterns of non-locally bound reflexives, there may
be many overlapping binding dependencies at the same time, and a binder can in
practice bind a '[REFL-I +, REFL-II +]' reflexive and a '[REFL-I +, REFL-II -]'
reflexive at the same time. By stacking the multiple 'I must be bound'
requirements in such a situation on a *list*, one may hope to be able to cope
with such situations as well, although for reasons pointed to in Hellan 2005,
non-trivial complexities arise. The present implementation is compatible with
such developments, in using a list-based algorithm, but it currently allows
only one-membered lists.
It may be noted that in most cases of multiple binding-relations cooccurring,
at least one relation would be with a 1st or 2nd person reflexive. The forms
for these reflexives - "meg/deg/oss/dere" - are homonyms with the corresponding
pronominal forms, and in case a reflexive parse fails for the reflexive, a
pronominal parse still comes out. In the MRS for the latter, no information is
really lost compared to what an MRS for the reflexive would have given, since
there is only one 1sg referent, or one 2sg referent, etc., per sentence.
Note that if a verb has an entry both for a 'tame' reflexive and for ordinary
object NPs, like "vaske" 'wash', then a sentence like "jeg vasker meg" will get
one parse where "meg" is a reflexive, and one where "meg" is a pronominal
(actually two parses for the latter, since "meg" as a pronominal is
underspecified with regard to status as discourse-bound - cf. section "'Light'
pronouns, and status of a personal pronoun as discourse-bound vs. not
discourse-bound"). 


For the 'non-lexical' binding constellations, the semantics of a binding
relation would most perspicuously be represented by identity of variables for
binder and bindee. To a limited extent, however, NorSource allows the INDEX
specification of a nominal item to host information which reflects local
dependencies of the item. For that reason, the semantic replica of a binding
relation is an MRS arg12-relational EP with the PRED-value
"coreferential-with_rel", and ARG1 and ARG2 being the ref-ind's of the binder
and the bindee, respectively. 

In the formalism, reciprocals are treated like reflexives.

No special algorithm is designed for 'Principle B' effects. The correct
semantics of "Ola liker ham" 'Ola likes him' is one where 'Ola' and 'him' have
distinct indices, and as the standard mechanism works, this is what is
derived anyway. As long as "ham" does not induce a "coreferential-with" EP, and
lexical frames for 'tame' reflexives specify the bindee as '[REFL-I +]',
whereas "ham" is specified as '[REFL-I -]', there is no way for a non-reflexive
to get the semantics of a reflexive. (The only additional situation in
Norwegian of a Principle B type is for cases like "Jon fort√¶rer seg selv/ *seg"
'Jon devours himself': here [seg] must be long distance bound. A mechanism
using an attribute 'WAIT-BND-RESP' accommodates this type of situation.)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

'Light' pronouns, and status of a personal pronoun as discourse-bound
vs. not discourse-bound

Intonational factors affecting this type of status are not represented in this
grammar, but placement relative to s-adverbs is: When a personal pronoun
precedes an s-adv like "ikke", it is interpreted as discourse-bound. 
Some pronouns are inherently marked for discourse-bound status, and the marking
for this status affects their admissible distribution relative to "ikke". (For
instance, a 'bare [seg]-reflexive is 'DISC-BOUND +'.)
The only situation where one gets double parses for a personal pronoun acting
as object, is when no s-adv occurs, and the pronoun itself is underspecified
for discourse-bound status. 
The marking of the parameter is '...LOCAL.CTXT.DISC-BOUND bool'. 

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Noun phrases

Noun phrases are treated as headed by the noun. We observe the convention that
in the MRS representation of an NP, there should be one and only one EP
introducing a quantifier binding the head noun variable (i.e., the variable
serving as value of ARG0 in the EP representing the head noun predicate, and as
INDEX of the head projection of the NP). Some principled *problems* pertaining
to this general convention are discussed in Beermann & Hellan 2005 [Nodalida],
and in the implementation, we note some practical problems too; see below. The
quantifier binding the head noun variable we call the Head Quantifier (HQ), and
the requirement that there should be only one such item we call the 'HQ-unique
Constraint'. 

Conventionally (i.e., for English), the HQ may be construed as being
contributed partly by word items such as articles - definite
and indefinite - and quantifiers, and partly through Specifier phrases like
Genitive phrases and measure phrases. These items all have the status as
Specifiers: since each NP is guaranteed (by the rules of English syntax) to
contain one and only one Specifier item (main exception being bare plurals),
the Specifier is thus the element through which the HQ-unique constraint is
obeyed. 

In Norwegian, the main exponent of definiteness is the suffixed article - this
holds both for singular and plural. In this central case, thus, the HQ is
contributed by the noun word rather than from a Specifier. 
It is also a fact of Norwegian syntax that bare singulars can be used
fairly freely; the need for syntactic Specifiers is less than in English. 
For these reasons, the present grammar takes the strategy of endowing the
following word forms with an HQ EP:
- definite singular, as in "gutten" 'boy-DEF', 
- indefinite plural, as in bare plurals like "gutter"  'boy-PL'and 
- definite plural, as in "guttene" 'boy-DEF.PL'. 
The HQ EP is introduced by an ltol-rule.

Singular forms not marked for definite do not introduce an HQ EP. Such
nouns can combine with quantifier items like "hver" 'each' and "ingen" 'no',
and with the sg articles "en", "ei", "et", which all provide an
HQ. Combination with genitives (as in "min gutt" 'my boy') and with measure
expressions (as in "to flasker vin" 'two bottles wine') induces an HQ
combinatorially (in C-CONT). For cases where no such source for an HQ appears,
an ltol-rule induces the HQ on the noun itself. In such cases, the SPR of the
noun is empty, whereas in the above cases where quantifiers, articles or
genitives/measure phrases contribute an HQ, these items are required by the
noun through a one-membered list as value of SPR.
Plural forms not marked for definite can also combine with quantifiers, like
"alle" 'all', "noen" 'some', and "ingen" 'no', and in these cases, it is the
quantifier and not the PL ending which contributes the HQ. The same goes for
genitives/measure phrases, as in "mine gutter" 'my boys' and "to kilo poteter"
'two kilos potatoes'. 
For both singular and plural nouns lacking a DEF suffix, there are thus two
combinatorial 'life lines' as encoded in the feature structure of the noun: one
reflected in an empty SPR and a RELS list containing the HQ EP, and one
reflected in a non-empty SPR, and lacking the HQ EP. 
 
Nouns carrying a DEF-suffix have the feature specification '..HEAD.DEFINITE
+'. For nouns not carrying this suffix, we have been careful in *not* calling
them 'indefinite': also noun forms not carrying the DEF suffix can be
part of NPs counted as 'definite', by the empirical criteria of being excluded
from a presentational construction, and being able to contain so-called 'weak'
form adjectives. An example is "min snille[WEAK] gutt" 'my kind boy'. The HEAD
specification of the head noun of any such NP reflects this definiteness by the
feature '..HEAD.DEF +'. 'DEFINITE +' entails 'DEF +', but not vice versa. When
a noun carries the features 'DEF +, DEFINITE -', it has a non-empty SPR, since
for instance a Genitive NP has to combine with it; if the noun has combined
with a weak adjective form, then also a demonstrative or a definite article
word "den/det/de" can fullfill the non-empty SPR.

When a noun is 'DEFINITE +', and hence has an HQ assigned in its semantics, it
may still take a SPR: it can always be preceded by a demonstrative (as in
"denne gutten" 'this boy'), and if preceded by an adjective (which is
necessarily weak when preceding a DEFINITE+ noun), then this sequence
'adj[WEAK]-N[DEFINITE+]' has to be prededed by a demonstrative or a definite
article word (as in "denne snille gutten" or "den snille gutten" 'this kind
boy'/ 'the kind boy'). Note that a Genitive is excluded in these cases: "*min
gutten" and "*min snille gutten" are impossible, it can only be "min gutt" or
"min snille gutt". This means that while a DEFINITE+ noun by itself may
optionally occur with a demonstrative, and thus with a specifier, the rule for
combining a weak adjective with a noun creates a non-empty 'obligatory'
SPR. 

What combines with a DEFINITE+ noun by itself is not regulated in the SPR
of the noun, but rather in the SPEC specification of potential Specifier words;
thus, for instance, demonstratives allow for it, quantifiers like "noen" 'some'
disallow it. 

Cardinals can combine with any kind of noun (in terms of DEF/DEFINITE
specifications), but when combining with a DEFINITE+ noun, the combination
creates a SPR requirement for a demonstrative or a definite article (just as
when a weak adjective combines with a noun). Whether cardinals should be
treated as modifiers or specifiers is not obvious - in earlier versions of
NorSource they were traeted as modifiers, but currently they are
specifiers. Semantically they introduce a 'measure-out' relation. Since
cardinals can be preceded by other specifiers (as in "mine tre gutter" with
"mine" as a specifier preceding "tre gutter", or "de tre guttene" with "de" as
a specifier preceding "tre gutter"), we cannot in general restrict the number
of specifiers relative to a given noun as being just one. 

In partitive constructions with the partitive preposition "av", "av" is a
hybrid, taking the NP as a complement, and the left-hand combinant as a
specifier. Its semantic contribution is "x instantiates y", where x is
introduced by the left-hand combinant (e.g. "hver", or a cardinal) and y by the
governed NP, as the 'larger set'.

Verbs (to be continued; this text relates to the types defined up to 2008, found in norsk.tdl, which have later been converted in lex-types-v.tdl (see introduction)):

The test file 'test-v' has examples of each verb frame recognized by the
grammar. Test-v itself is annotated with the phrasal rules relevant for each
verb type, along with types of other relevant items in the argument frame. 

In the present file, we show and comment on the MRSes generated for each
verb type. With example (1), we also explain some of the annotations generally used.

Comments:
The variable e2 represents the event type associated with verbs ('event-verb';
prepositions and adjectives have another event type, 'ad-event'). In addition
to its standard expansions 'E tam' and 'SORT semsort', it has the following
attributes:
  PATH-TELIC bool, representing telicity effects of adverbial modification;
  INCR-TELIC bool, representing 'Aktionsart', i.e., aspectual class of verbs
  ROLE role, as defined in predsort.tdl (see references [3] and [4])
  WH bool, representing whether the item is 'questioned' or not.
Under 'E tam', the following features are declared:
  TENSE tense, with subtypes 'finite', being 'present' and 'past', and
  'non-finite', being 'infin' and 'perf' ('present participle' is analyzed as
  an adjective, derived by the ltow-rule presparticpl-adj-lxm)
  MOOD mood, being indicative and imperative
  ASPECT semsort, not further developed in norsk.tdl, but used in predsort.tdl
  DELIMITED bool, representing telicity effects induced by the semantics of NPs
  (reflected on the NP by the feature 'BOUNDED bool')

The variable x4 represents the type ref-ind. 'WH' and 'ROLE' are as above. The
path PNG.NG defines a type for gender and number combined, and PNG.PERS a type
for person. BOUNDED bool represents whether the semantics of the NP induces
telicity for the entire clause or not (so far, such an effect only reflects the
object of a clause).

instantiates
(a) The ARG1 of the preposition "mot" is identified with the ARG1 of the
verb. Directional prepositions achieve this effect; they modify verbs, one of
whose arguments is propagated into the verb's HOOK as DIRARG (the type serving
as value of HOOK is here 'dirhook', as opposed to 'hook' for nondirectional
verbs), and the XARG of the preposition (equal to its ARG1) is identified with
the verb's DIRARG. In this case, the DIRARG is the subject of the verb; it can
also be the object, cf. the type arg1-2dir-verb-lexeme.
(b) "mot" 's lexical entry is:
mot_diratel_p := dir-nonfixpoint-prep-word &
  [ STEM < "mot" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL [PRED "_mot_p_rel"],
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL toward-targetpoint-rel].
Its sign type 'dir-nonfixpoint-prep-word' induces the
aspectual value 'PATH-TELIC bool', as opposed to prepositions of type
'dir-fixpoint-prep-word' which induce 'PATH-TELIC +'. 
The KEYREL type 'toward-targetpoint-rel' is defined in preposrt.tdl, and induces
the ROLE values shown for ARG0, ARG1, ARG2 and IARG. The value of ARG0.SORT is
induced by 'dir-nonfixpoint-prep-word', and likewise the values of ARG1.SORT
 and ARG2.SORT, but for these in conjunction with the x-type arguments (both inheriting from 'inan-thing & full-thing').

instantiates that "om fjellet" ('about the mountain') is predicated of the
event as such, represented by 'e2'; however, e2 is here to be seen as a TALKING
event, and not just a set of time and place coordinates. The effect is induced
by the type 'intrans-obl-verb-lexeme' together with 'prep-word-sel', crucially
involving KEYS.KEY specifications; thus, the lexical entry of "snakke"
relevant is:
snakke_intr-obl-om := intrans-obl-verb-lexeme &
 [ STEM < "snakke" >,
   INFLECTION v1-v1b-v11,
   SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_snakke_v_rel",
   SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.ICOMPS < [LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY om-fct-spec ]]> ].
and for "om":
om_sel := prep-word-sel &
  [ STEM < "om" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_om_p_rel",
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY om-topic-of ]].
(where 'om-topic-of' is a subtype of 'om-fct-spec').

Note that the relevant attribute inside VAL here is ICOMPS - this is where
so-called 'oblique' PPs are entered as arguments of the verb.

COMMENT:   
In the MRS, the interrogative nature of "hvorvidt" 'whether' has to be read off
the PRED value; obviously the EP

[ proposition_m_rel
            LBL: h12
            MARG: h20 ]

should have 'question_m_rel' rather than 'proposition_...'.
In the phrasal combinatorics, selection is done by reference to a head feature
'DECL bool'. Thus,
"om", as selected by "snakke", allows its clausal complement to be either 
  LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.DECL -
or
  LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.DECL +.
In contrast, the "p√•" selected by "stole" allows only 
  LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.DECL + ( a hack here: this is made hold for clause-taking "p√•"
  in general, and not as taken by "stole"; needs amendment)
hence the non-parse for sentence (8) & (9):

(8) * jeg stoler p√• hvorvidt du kommer
(9) * jeg stoler p√• hvem som kommer

Similar to (6) is (7), as far as combinatorics is concerned, but here the MRS
is more revealing about the interrogative force (induced by the subj-verb
combination):

(7) jeg snakker om hvem som kommer
    I talk-PRES about who that come-PRES
    'I talk about who comes'

different analysis:

This p√•-PP is in the COMPS list, and "p√•" here belongs to a different type than
in connection with "stole", just as "lure" is of a different type:

lure_indirwhquest-pp := intrans-indirwhquest-pp-verb-lexeme &
  [ STEM < "lure" >,
    INFLECTION v2,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_lure_v_rel",
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < [LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY p√•-indirqu ]]>].

p√•_indirwhquest := prep-indirwhquest-word &
  [ STEM < "p√•" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_p√•_p_rel",
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY p√•-indirqu]].

The intuition is that verbs of this type are more directly tied to the
interrogative clause; in the MRS, this is reflected in that the ARG1 of the
preposition ("p√•") is not linked to anything.

(11) Jon lurer p√• hvorvidt du kommer
     Jon wonder-PRES on whether you come-PRES

uses the same "lure" and the same "p√•"; the MRS is now less telling about the
interrogative embedding, since no interrogative combination rule is at force -
cf. (6).

Combinatorially, this "p√•" selects the head feature DECL -, hence combination
with a that-clause is blocked, as in

LKB(13): 

COMMENT:
The item "h√∏res" is treated analogously to 'seem' or 'sound', as taking as sole
semantic argument a proposition, with the content 'he sick'. 
e2, the index of the 'sounding' event, is qualified by "ut", semantically
glossed as _of-appearance_a_rel; the EP
         [ \"_of-appearance_a_rel\"
            LBL: h11
            ARG0: u12 [ u SORT: SEMSORT ROLE: ROLE WH: BOOL ]
            ARG1: e2 ]
thus signals "ut" as functioning as a kind of evidentiality marker, like in
German "er sieht krank aus"/"er h√∂rt sich krank an".

"ut" is categorized as 'adverb', but as a subclass called 'particle'. Both
"syk" and "ut" are on the verb's COMPS list, with "ut" particularly selected by
"h√∏res", by the following lexical entries:

h√∏res_sec-ut := intrans-secpred-prtcl1-rais-from-nonverbal-arg1-verb-lexeme &
  [ STEM < "h√∏res" >,
    INFLECTION v100,
    SYNSEM [LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_h√∏res_v_rel"],
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < [], [LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY ut-pcl ]]>].

  [ STEM < "ut" >,
    SYNSEM [LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.KEYS.KEY ut-pcl,
            LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_of-appearance_a_rel"]].

Combinatorial rules are head-verb-adj-comp-rule and
head-verb-advparticle-comp-rule, reflecting structure

COMMENT:
"late" has the same basic semantics as the verbs in the previous examples, as
taking as sole semantic argument a proposition, with the content 'he come'. The
latter is technically embedded under the ARG1 of the matrix verb via a chain of
qeq's, these being induced by the preposition "til", which otherwise has no
reflex in the MRS in this use, categorized as 'prep-rais-word'. It gets
selected by the verb through the following entries:

late_til-√•-rais := intrans-secpred-rais-from-nonverbal-arg1-verb-lexeme &
  [ STEM < "late" >,
    INFLECTION v102,
    SYNSEM [LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_late_v_rel",
            LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS <[LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.KEYS.KEY til-rais ]>]].

til_rais := prep-rais-word &
  [ STEM < "til" >,
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [KEYS.KEY til-rais ] ].

Both "late" and "til" have a 'raising' combinatorics, mediating subject
requirements of the embedded verb to requirements of the matrix verb. We
thereby also account for

COMMENT: The embedded verbal construction is a presentational construction, and
its requirement of an expletive subject is meediated to the matrix
verb. Through the non-parse of (17), one observes that the indefiniteness
restriction on the NP following the main verb is maintained:

(18)  * det later til √• komme gutten

In many cases, a raising verb can alternatively occur with a finite clause, and
an expletive subject. "late til" is such a case:

(19)  det later til at gutten kommer
; it appears to-PREP that comes the boy
;  'it appears that the boy comes'

COMMENT: the type of "late" is as before, but "til" is now non-transparent, and
has the type 'prep-expl-dep-word'. 

The above cases illustrate
- a raising verb alone
- a raising verb with a particle
- a raising verb with a 'transparent' PP
We next look at a case where the raising verb occurs both with a particle and a
transparent PP:

"som" is prep-expl-dep-word, like "til" in "late til", and "se ut" is the same
as in the previous cases, repeated, even though the second selected item now
has the shape "som":

se_ut-til := intrans-secpred-prtcl2-rais-from-nonverbal-arg1-verb-lexeme &

COMMENT:
The equivalence of MRSes for (23) and (24) misses a maening difference: with
"som om", there is something like an irrealis presupposition, signalling that
the boy doesn't actually come. Absence of such a presupposition we get with:

(25)  det ser ut som gutten kommer

With the tree structure indicated for (24), it is difficult to give the lexical
item control of the irrealis factor, since the "om" is one step too deeply
embedded. An alternative is to treat "som om" as one item, alternating wiith
"som", and have two distinct entries for the verb, one with the irrealis factor
and one without.
A case suggesting that there is some compositionality in the "som om" sequence
is

(26)  det ser ut som at gutten kommer

which on the current analysis has the same MRS as immediately above, just with
"at_rel" instead of "om_rel". On the alternative analysis, "som at" would be
treated as another unit. Aother reason for a compositional approach to "som om"
is that the effect of "om" here may be traced to other uses of "om", as
introducing question clauses.
Pending a non-ad hoc treatment of the irrealis vs realis factor, we so far
stick to the analysis presented, on which (25) does not yet have an analysis;
the line of amending the account probably will treat "som om" and "som at" as
units here, alternating with "som" as in (25).
