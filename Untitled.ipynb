       "[<p>While it is hard to imagine that <a href=\"https://time.com/game-of-thrones-2017/\"><em>Game of Thrones</em> </a>needs to remind people to tune in for its final season, the HBO series is not above sending a not-so-subtle reminder to fans to watch the show’s season premiere. That reminder? They set the Bellagio fountains on fire.</p>,\n",
       " <p>To build some buzz for the show’s already <a href=\"https://time.com/5501931/game-of-thrones-teaser-bran-stark/\">buzzworthy return</a>, <em>Game of Thrones</em> left Westeros for the Las Vegas, taking over the world-famous Bellagio Fountains to put on a special show. Fans lined up around the landmark to watch as winter came to Las Vegas. As tourists gawked, Lake Bellagio transformed into an 800-foot-long water wall, rising up to remind fans of the wall that was meant to keep the White Walkers out of Westeros. The jaw-dropping wall of water became a canvas as the imaginative creators projected falling snow, the infamous <em>Game of Thrones</em> logo, and filled the night with silhouettes of the dragons breathing orange and blue flames. The Night King even made an appearance and water jets formed the shape of a crown and throne, setting the stage for the final showdown for the Iron Throne. It was all set to a soundtrack created by the show’s award-winning composer Ramin Dhawadi.</p>,\n",
       " <p>That wasn’t the end of the spectacle, though.
