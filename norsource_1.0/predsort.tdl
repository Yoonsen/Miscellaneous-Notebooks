;;;  Definitions of semantic types for spatio-temporal prepositions and adverbs
;;;
;;;  Created by Dorothee Beermann and Lars Hellan
;;; 
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; predsort.tdl is a package of lexical semantic constraints on 
;; relational types. ROLE sorts are introduced to
;; formulate restrictions in terms of thematic information. 
;; CLASS information introduces conceptual information
;; for all main predicates, covering verb class information, qualia information
;; and spatial and temporal classes for prepositions and adverbs.

;;; (For description of the system, see [Hellan and Beermann 2005-SIGSEM-ACL].)

;;; This version has type definitions suited for going directly together with the matrix.tdl file already used in norsource, which is a somewhat customized version 0.6 matrix.tdl. A version called predsort_for_standardMtrx.tdl is suited for going with a standard Matrix 1.0 version.  

;; addition, March06, LH
;; The file is activated by lex3.p-adv-prepsort.tdl or by lex3.p-adv-full.tdl.
;; In the former case, only the following types from norsk.tdl are to be used:
;;   iarg-orient-adv-relation
;;   adv-mod-relation
;;   prep-mod-relation
;; In the latter case, the following types from norsk.tdl are also used:
;; (search for OBS!, in case you want to comment away that inheritance)
;;   end-of-path-rel
;;   beginning-of-path-rel
;;   via-path-rel
;;   along-path-rel
;;   prep-nonfixpoint-line-rel
;; 
;; The ASPECT specifications used under INCR-ASPECT in norsk.tdl also come from here. And so do the verb-lexeme types given in norsk.tdl that are defined at the spot with the comment "the i-synsemers"
