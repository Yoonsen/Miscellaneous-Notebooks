Harry, Ron, Hagrid, \\n DUMBLEDORE\\n!!!! I love each of them very much. Oh sorry, I forgot to mention Voldemort. But I love him as the villian.This series gets improve with every next installment. From Sorcerer's Stone to Prisoner of Azkaban I don't remember a page which I didn't enjoy.As far as this book is concern, I adored it. Excitement was limitless. Stakes were higher than the previous ones. Even though I was missing Voldemort, I still enjoyed it.\\nOVERVIEW\\nSirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, a prison for criminal wizards, which no one has broken but him. He is after Harry (view spoiler)[apparently  (hide spoiler)]. He is believed to be the one who helped Voldemort in killing Harry's parents.\\n RANDOM THOUGHTS\\n=>I liked what Harry did to Aunt Marge. Hehehe...=>This book started slowly towards the main plot. There were many Quidditch matches which actually didn't have to do anything with the plot. BUT it's my favourite sport. I love reading it. Privately, I really wish that I could play it. Last year my friend on GR recommended a book entirely based on this sport. In this year, I will read it after finishing this series.=>You know what? During reading, I was thinking 'why Sirius isn't showing up'. There were just talks about him. But in the end, I came to know that, I was reading him all the time but I was ignoring him.=>Dementors were great. I liked the concept of them. And Dementor's Kiss. I literally shivered on the effects of it.=>There was a very shocking revelation. Ron's rat!! What it turned out in the ending was mouth-dropping.Overall, an amazing installment in the HP series.🌟🌟🌟5 Stars🌟🌟🌟P.S. I have read the whole series in the last month. You see? That's the problem when you read books without using Goodreads. Have to write reviews now.June 7, 2017\",\n",

       " 'freeText3701030883359961493': \" 5 Expecto Patronum stars! I grew up with Harry Potter. Yes, I am that generation. I was a little bit younger than 11 when the books were released, and when the final book was published I had just graduated high school. I'm also the same age as Daniel Radcliffe and he's only older than me by less than a month. I also have a deathly hallows bumper sticker on my car. So, I think it's safe to say that this series has had a profound effect on me, to the point where I am still a little bit bitter that I never got my Hogwarts acceptance letter.A couple years ago I reread the first two books in the series and loved them just as much as when I was a kid. So when I got into a horrible reading slump, I saw my dad watching Harry Potter weekend on ABC Family (as he does for every fucking Harry Potter weekend mind you), I said to myself, what the hell. Time for a reread. So hence, Harry Potter 3 reread. All of us may know the story but I am going to reiterate. In his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns that a dangerous man named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry then overhears the fact that Black is the reason his parents are dead, as Black sold them out to Voldemort and then killed 13 people in broad daylight.  So in a unique part of the review from me, here are all the amazing parts of this book that I forgot because I've been watching the movies instead: -Peeves the Poltergeist: Holy crap how did I forget about this hilarious menacing spirit? He's not as present in this book but he has always had a part in the series and I completely forgot he existed! I know they can't include everything in the movies but I wish Peeves had been included.-Charlie Weasley: Ron had yet ANOTHER sibling that is only mentioned in the films! This one is the cool brother in Egypt.-Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory: there are soooooo many mentions of Cho and Cedric in this book! I never really noticed Cedric until the 4th book where he becomes prominent. And this is the book where Harry's crush on Cho began. Stomach flutters!-More details on Whomping Willow/Shrieking Shack: This may be a spoiler for those of you who haven't read it, but the Whomping Willow was actually planted to hide Lupin's werewolfism as well as the shrieking shack to hide him. I thought this little tidbit was super interesting, along with the details of how Black escaped Azkaban. And just in general, I love JK Rowling's ability to tie things together. There's so much in this book that becomes important later and tiny little details and sharp wit that make me giggle. So in a small factoid, this book is probably my least favorite of the entire series. It's good, obviously, but for some reason I like all the other ones better. The movie, well it's my second to last favorite (just ahead of that godawful Goblet of Fire film which ruined everything but I digress). The movie director added so many unnecessary things that weren't in the book, and I wish he hadn't so he could of kept the good stuff! (And I've heard a rumor that he didn't even read the fucking book until JK kept vetoing all of his weird ideas. Look it up!)If you haven't read these books, do not tell me!!!!! I will smack you!\",\n",

Not the book... the character... this was the first time for me where I really stood back and said \"He\\'s growing up. He\\'s realizing not everything around him should be believed without a hint of doubt.\" When he protected Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, it all changed for me.2. Dementors are awesome. I love the concept of stealing someone\\'s soul through sucking their physical body off its bones.3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It\\'s like our core is bursting to show itself.4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I\\'d want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all.5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that\\'s my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me.See, that wasn\\'t so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won\\'t be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for.\\n\\nAbout Me\\n\\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here\\'s the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

I think this is my favorite of all the Harry Potter books thus far. This is the one that introduces Sirius Black, who I sometimes loathe (only sometimes!) and Remus Lupin, who I will always, always love. And of course, this is the book that gave us one piece of Severus Snape's background. And that was the infamous Prank that may or may not have destroyed Snape's trust in Dumbledore. Would you have trusted someone who didn't at least suspend the one who'd tried to kill you? I don't think so. This is also the book where I found myself looking at Dumbledore with a new eye. He's a crafty old fella, I tell you that. He'll do anything to gain his means, regardless of how he may personally feel on the matter. Grandpa Albus, he ain't.

Instead I will tell you what made me read these books.So after being told numerous times to read HP by Potterheads (90% of my friends are dedicated Potterheads), I didn\\'t budge a millimeter. Then one fine day I decided to take Book Riot\\'s \"Who\\'s your Book Boyfriend?\" Quiz. I was looking for Darcy, Aragorn, or even Jon Snow would have made me happy, but I got Sirius Black. Potterheads took the same quiz and got Darcy (I was so jealous!), Jay Gatsby, and others but none got Sirius Black. Talk about Karma.So I decided it\\'s time to read Harry Potter, at least the first three to meet Sirius Black. After eating out the heads of Potterheads for 70% of the book, I was out of my mind. I was angry. Can you blame me? I was reading the book to meet my BBF and he was nowhere to be seen. I wanted us to spend some quality time together, know each other but I lost hope. Nothing could be done in last 15-20% to redeem him.But but the moment finally arrived when we met. I agree the time we spent together was short but no qualms as he was nice, honest, easy to love. By the time we said our goodbyes, my heart was \"Siriusly Black\". And that\\'s what matters, all my complaints went outta window and I fell in love with my Book Boyfriend. So I find it funny how people change. I used to laugh at my friends for their Sirius devotion and now I snap at anyone who dare to tell me that they love him. I just tell them, \"he is MINE MINE MINE and MINE\".',\n",

I really just completely and utterly loved this book.SECOND READTHIS REVIEW IS ALSO ON MY BLOG - CHECK IT OUT HEREIn case you haven’t read or seen Harry Potter this review will contain spoilers. I would usually say read it, but my best friend doesn’t enjoy Harry Potter so it’s okay if you don’t enjoy this franchise.Also, a note, I know there is a lot of drama with JK Rowling regarding the Fantastic Beasts franchise, and trust me this isn’t me supporting her. I have copies of the books that I read last year and fell in love with. The films helped me through tough stages in my life. Harry was the first character I ever saw or was able to identify had PTSD. Something very important to me after my diagnosis. JK Rowling has since lost my support by backing Johnny Depp, but I can’t help but still fall into this world she created.Thank you, now for the review. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has to be my favourite in the series. Both film and novel wise. It is engaging, it is intense and it has hope. Hope that is missing from many of the books. This hope provided throughout the book is one of family. A future. I adore it. I adore Sirius Black. I adore Remus Lupin. I just have so much love for the cast of characters throughout this book, it is honestly crazy.The characters are still quite young in this book, thirteen, and struggling to work out where they fit into this magic world. Of course, there is a threat on Harry’s life, because would it be a year at Hogwarts if there wasn’t? There is still Snape being a dick to children but still getting his redemption arc in the final book. There is still sweet Neville being slammed. There is a whole series of messes throughout this book.Harry Potter 3 begins with Harry at his aunt and uncles, struggling through the summer in order to get back to school and see his friend. Of course, a problem occurs within the Dursley house and he runs away with his trunk and wand. Little does he know that an alleged killer is on the lose…hunting him. This time it strangely isn’t Voldemort either.I really thought writing a review for this was a good idea but the further I get in the more I’m realising my brain is complete mush when it comes to explaining the Harry Potter franchise. I think this review was primarily a reason to explain that I don’t support JK Rowling as a person anymore, makes me incredibly glad that I bought my copies of the books second hand.I just really love this book in particular and reading it makes me want to cry. The love that Sirius and Lupin both have for Harry brings a tear for my eye. Especially because of their fates in later books. They deserved better.Which Harry Potter book is your favourite?\",\n",

I only have to remarks:- Just as in Philosopher\\'s Stone and Chamber of Secrets, there\\'s fatphobia in Prisoner of Azkaban. I already discussed that in my reviews of those books, so won\\'t go into detail again. But Rowling does this over and over again: her unlikeable characters, such as Vernon, Dudley, Crabbe and Goyle are fat and - according to her - therefore disgusting. Having to read sentences like \"He has five chins and piggy little eyes\", in which Rowling describes her fat characters like pigs rather then people, is absolutely horrible. She does very often and not a lot of readers seem to address this issue.- The guards at Azkaban told Fudge that Sirius talks in his sleep. But in Goblet of Fire, we learn that the only guards at Azkaban are the dementors. I\\'ve done some research and there is still so much we don\\'t know about those creatures! I\\'d be very interested to learn how they\\'re able to communicate. ------------------Re-read November 2015It took me over a month to read this, because I have been so busy with college. It definitely got in the way of my reading experience, but I loved POA nonetheless! It has been two or three years since I\\'ve read it and I forgot so much! My only complaint is that there were a lot of references to events in previous books. She explained Quidditch again, told us who Ron and Hermione are, what happened at the end of last school year... And to me, that wasn\\'t necessary.There are some differences between the film and book (not as many as the later books/films though), but I don\\'t really mind! The film is my absolute favourite, I like the changes they\\'ve made (expect for leaving out information about the Marauders) so I don\\'t really know which one I actually prefer :) JK Rowling really needs to come out with a prequel ASAP! I love this book so much because of the Marauders, and I wish we knew more about them and their era. I think we can all agree that we\\'d prefer a prequel over a sequel, such as The Cursed Child. And yes, I know about Fantastic Beasts, but that\\'s not really Potter related so that doesn\\'t count ;)',\n",

Thus, Prisoner of Azkaban carries a hefty helping of something so terribly thrilling, it nearly pains me to think that too many adults view these as children's books, because Jo dove headfirst into the Gringotts vault and crafted, what? A SPY THRILLER???Hah! Expecto Patronum!Hitchockian to the last word, Jo uses her mastery of psychology to create a false villain in Sirius Black, deepening the story to masterful levels with her careful use of incredibly dangerous ingredients, such as the Marauder's Map and the Time Turner. With her weaving of even more unpredictable elements like Animagi and Snape's jealousy, Prisoner of Azkaban suddenly begins to bubble over, like an experiment gone wrong, exploding with too many wild ingredients.Or not.This Hippogriff of a book doesn't die under the burden of being misunderstood…this Hippogriff takes to the sky, spreads its wings, and flies.Because at the foundation of all the wild, wacky, and fun, lies the deeply disturbing, the dangerous, the dementing, dark and deadly details undergirding the perfectly planned acceleration of magical mystery to spy thriller. Double-crosses and old secrets, misunderstood wizards and life-changing choices on full display under the waxy silver light of a full moon, who is it that saves the day?Expecto Patronum!That's right. Just look at that cover. Because this book is about perception and reality, and about the destiny of realizing what is true within and letting it out.Dementors be damned, this book is Siriusly amazing.Recommended for everyone.\",\n",

Let us stop here for a second because I want to ask myself a following question. Why do I even bother with the plot descriptions? Is it possible to find a modern educated person with even passing interest in literature who never read the books and never saw the movies? However I already wrote the previous paragraph, so I am not going to erase it.This is the first book of the series which made me realize that we are not in Kansas anymore - to quote another children classic (yes, I call Harry Potter a children classic series). This is the place where the series leave comfortable and fluffy status of simple children books and slowly crosses in to an adult territory. I would call it young adult, but the modern understanding of the term demands a presence of heartbreaking romance and Harry Potter does not fit. To make a long story short do not expect a happy ending here, but do expect some quite dark moments.I thought about reducing the otherwise perfect rating by one star because of some minor inconsistencies and the whole Time Turner thingy. I would not call the latter Deux Ex Machina as it did not come up from nowhere, but it was way too convenient for the final resolution for me. The fact that it completely disappears from the series never again to be heard about does not help any. Still this was not big enough annoyance for the lower rating, so the 5 stars remain. So the book is very much worth reading - as if I need to say it. I had exactly the same amount of fun rereading the book as I had during my first read; knowing what would happen next had not diminish my enjoyment any. \",\n",

I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3 hour stretch, BOTH times, was much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it.Yes, the book has it, but the build up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at.... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media.The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgement as to whether the book is as well.

I just really want Harry to be happy and I feel like he (and kind of his history/backstory) is given so much depth in POA. The connection between Harry and Sirius, and Harry finally finding a father figure in both Lupin and Sirius is really important to me, as well as them providing a framework for him being able to \"get to know\" his parents. I find the whole Marauder\\'s story kind of tragic - with Lupin & Sirius losing their best friend (and, due to Peter\\'s betrayal, 13 years worth of time with Harry) and so the huge focus of the marauders in this book just makes it an absolute favourite of mine. The ending of the book where Harry gets his letter from Sirius and reads it \"over and over\" and is just so happy makes me happy like bb you deserve all the happiness in the world ANYWAY:psa this book gets MUCH SADDER each time you reread. When you reread it knowing everything about the past and future of these characters it is much, much sadder. Like Lupin saying he \"knew\" James and Sirius in school. KNEW HIM !?! SHUT UP THEY WERE YOUR BEST FRIENDS AND YOU LOVED THEMOr like, Hagrid talking about how Sirius was there when James and Lily died OH GOD AND IT MAKES ME SO SAD because you know he was wrongly arrested hours later arrghhh I also think that the Quidditch matches in this book are some of the best in the whole series - the one where Gryffindor win the Quidditch Cup is THE BEST of the series, hands down. On top of that, we also see time travelling Hermione, Hagrid as a teacher, Hermione being a total badass (damn that hit on Malfoy tho) and breaking rules all over the place, HARRY GETTIN HIS FIREBOLT (a pivotal moment in the young kids life ok), Lupin actually being a good DATDA teacher, Harry & the sexual awakening (Cho Chang got him feeling things omfg ) the Boggart scene, Harry learning to cast a partonus !! Buckbeak !!, Hogsmede (and that damn perfect scene where Fudge talk about Sirius), Ron getting Pig, the Marauders Map, -- Fred & George study in this one ??? and an emotional chat between Dumbledore and Harry about his parents and his choices which was such a perfect conclusion to the book honestly. Also can we talk about how gloriously Harry\\'s sass shows in this one because he was quippin all over the placeI love POA so much, it\\'s probably the only book I literally wish was longer. I honestly ACHE for more of this, I know there is nothing else.

Da hun ankommer landsbyen Pláka, oppdager Alexis at den ligger et steinkast fra den forlatte øya Spinalonga, ei øy som tidligere var bebodd av spedalske.

Moren vokste opp på Kreta før hun giftet seg og flyttet til London, og hun skjønner nå at hun er nødt til å innvie datteren i forholdene hun kommer fra. Hun utstyrer Alexis med et brev som hun skal levere til hennes gamle venn Fortini, og i dette brevet ber hun Fortini fortelle alt.</p><p>Alexis ankommer Kreta og oppsøker Fortini. Hun får da høre historien som knytter familien hennes til øya Spinalonga, en tidligere koloni for spedalske. Hennes innsikt i familieforholdene gjør noe med henne. Der moren så svik, ser hun lidenskap og kjærlighet. Dette får avgjørende betydning for hennes egne valg.</p><p>Dette er en hjerteskjærende historie om en tid da det var knyttet mange fordommer til spedalskhet og faren for smittsomhet, om kjærlighet og svik, om livet på øya Spinalonga på godt og vondt og ikke minst om samhold i et gresk lokalsamfunn. Spinalonga eksisterer i virkeligheten, selv om det er noen år siden spedalske ble isolert fra samfunnet. Denne historien rørte meg dypt. Jeg opplevde boka er godt skrevet og Gisken Armand leste den med stor innlevelse. </p><p>I ettertid har mange kritisert denne boka som en typisk lettvekter innenfor bestselgergenren. Jeg ønsker imidlertid å understreke at Victoria Hislop var den første som brukte fortellergrepet med en rammefortelling og en roman i romanen - en oppskrift mange har kopiert i ettertid. Og selv om boka ikke kommer til å bli stående som en mesterlig roman for ettertiden, var det ingen som hadde fortalt den fascinerende historien om Spinalonga, de spedalskes øy, før henne. Historien som sådan er både spennende, trist og opprørende.</p></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"verktoy\"><a class=\"btn btn-small stjernelink\" data-loading-text=\"Jobber ...\" data-feil-text=\"I\\'m sorry, Dave.
